Brain Stroke Prediction Website is a web application designed to predict the risk of brain stroke based on critical health indicators such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, glucose level, and BMI. Users input these details through an intuitive React-based frontend styled with HTML and CSS, which then communicates with a Python Flask backend that processes the data and uses a trained machine learning model to generate predictions. This full-stack solution combines the power of JavaScript, React, and Flask to deliver real-time, accessible stroke risk assessments for early intervention and health awareness.
